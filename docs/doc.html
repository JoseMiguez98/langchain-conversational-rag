    <h1>Developing a Chatbot Assistant with RAG Architecture</h1>
    <p>In approaching the challenge of developing a chatbot assistant using the RAG architecture, I found the technical aspects manageable due to my prior understanding of vector databases, tokenization, embeddings, and large language models (LLMs). However, the most challenging part was learning the new technology, LangChain/LangGraph, and effectively coupling all the logic together. While LangChain appears straightforward, I found it somewhat confusing due to its abstract paradigm that blends natural language processing, reasoning, and traditional coding.</p>
    <p>This challenge was both interesting and entertaining, pushing me to deepen my knowledge in an engaging way.</p>
